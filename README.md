# My Personal Project
<h3>Description of the project</h3>
The application will be a roulette game but with just the colour wheel . The player starts with a set amount of money. They can place their money on either black, red , or green.  
The application will choose a **random** number which will have an associated colour.  
If they choose the correct category for the randomly generated number and associated color, the amount they put in will be multiplied by 2 if they pick black or red correctly and by 35 if picked green correctly. 

<h3>People who will use it</h3>
People who will use it are people who want to play for fun. Sometimes people do not want to take the risk of gambling with real money but just want to play the games to see their luck. 

<h3>Why this project interests me</h3>
This project interests me because this is one of the few games in the casino that I understand how to play, and I can play without others. When playing this game at the casino I also only play within the colours and do not split into specific numbers etc.
